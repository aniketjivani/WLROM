Code coming soon

Need to do
- create a requirements file (`pipreqs`)? - done a crude version

- setup an `src` folder with required utilities for plotting, IO, etc.

- (later) GitHub actions for generating notebooks from percent py scripts with jupytext

Technical side to check:

NeuroDiffEq - https://github.com/NeuroDiffGym/neurodiffeq - need to see if we can use functions / examples from here as demo (but general idea seems slightly different?)


some analytical CFD examples in section 3 of this study? [RG Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338867908_Artificial_Neutral_Networks_ANNs_Applied_as_CFD_Optimization_Techniques)
